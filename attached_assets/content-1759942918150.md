## Abstract:

Senor nodes either deployed for environment monitoring or health monitoring are battery operated, and thus energy constrained. This paper proposes a novel method for energy harvesting for the Internet of things (IoT) based applications by exploiting the inherent inadequacies of the sampling process. The sensor nodes generate a continuous-time signal corresponding to the sensed parameters, which sampled and digitized for further processing. However, the traditional sampling process discarded most of the input signal energy, which could be harvested to supplement the sensor node itself. The sampling interval (i.e., the duration between two samples) of the sampling process, is composed of acquisition and hold time. During acquisition time, the continuous-time input signal is connected to a capacitor for acquiring the input signal value, while in hold time, the capacitor holds the acquired value and disconnects from the input signal. Therefore, during the hold time, the input signal energy is wasted, making the overall sampling process inadequate. This paper overcomes these inadequacies by modifying the circuitry of the sampling process during the hold time. It thus harvests the energy from the input signal obtained through a sensing element without affecting the overall performance of the system. To validate the proposed method, a hardware setup has been designed to sample and harvest the energy for both the environment as well as health monitoring application.

### I. Introduction

Research in energy harvesting (EH) has been gaining popularity for developing an alternative form of energy to supplement the energy-constrained devices \[1\]. Typical sources of EH are thermal, wind, solar and radio frequency (RF) signals. The applications of energy harvesting include, but not limited to, health monitoring, environment monitoring, wireless communication, radio frequency identifications (RFIDs), building and home automation. However, the Internet of things (IoT) based applications are prominent beneficiaries of the EH methods. The reason being, sensor nodes are battery-operated devices which are generally deployed on remote location for environmental monitoring or implanted on the human body for health monitoring. In both cases, replacing and recharging batteries are arduous tasks. To address these problems, many approaches have been proposed to create a self-sustainable sensor node by harvesting the energy from ambient sources \[1\]–\[4\], or by reducing the power consumption of the sensor node which includes various power management and transmission strategies \[5\]. In \[1\] thermal electric generator (TEG) has been utilized to harvest the energy from a temperature gradient, which is used to power the wireless sensors without the need for batteries. Similarly, in \[2\] energy has been harvested from the ambient sources to develop a battery free sensor node for body area network (BAN) which may continuously communicate with personal remote medical staff through the Internet. However, in \[3\] energy is harvested from the human body for powering the biomedical devices implanted inside or on the surface of the human body. This is due to the fact that human heat and motion are an excellent source of energy. Furthermore, in \[4\], a multi-source architecture is presented to harvest the energy from multiple sources. Unlike above, \[6\], \[7\] provide effective circuit design to harvest maximum available power. For instance, in \[6\], a power management circuit has been designed to harvest energy from low power ambient sources. Further, \[7\] has designed a battery-free programmable RFID sensor device by harvesting the energy from RF signal. It is obvious from the above discussion that most of the prior work are leveraging different possible ambient sources or providing advancement in circuit designing to harvest the maximum available energy.
