# System and method for irradiance estimation on solar panels

### Abstract     translated from

The present disclosure provides a system (100) configured for irradiance estimation on solar panels. The system (100) can include a computing device (106) that is configured to perform the calculation of the edges of all obstacles. The computing device (106) is configured to perform the calculation of the sun's position at each hour based on the geolocation coordinates like latitude, longitude and altitude. For each solar panel, the tilt and azimuth are considered. A ray of light is traced by simulation from the solar panel to the direction of the sun. If there is any obstacle that obstructs the ray, that particular panel is considered shaded in that timestamp. If there is no obstacle between the panel and the sun, then the panel is considered unshaded.

SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR IRRADIANCE ESTIMATION ON SOLAR PANELS

TECHNICAL FIELD

\[0001\] The present disclosure relates, in general, to renewable power systems, and more specifically, relates to a system and method for irradiance estimation on solar panels.

BACKGROUND

\[0002\] As the human population continues to grow, the need for energy, electricity and water is at an all-time high. Renewable energy came to be an alternative energy source that could one day replace currently used sources like fossil fuels. Solar energy is an alternative to clean and renewable energy that could solve environmental problems.

\[0003\] With the increasing popularity of solar panels, it has become increasingly desirable to map the relative concentration of solar radiation hitting the earth's surface in different geographic locations. This may be useful to determine whether to buy a photovoltaic solar system, the appropriate size of the system and the proper angle of installation. Solar irradiance, the energy from the sun's electromagnetic radiation, has a wide range of applications from meteorology to agronomy. Constructing detailed irradiance maps is a challenging but important goal.

\[0004\] Shadow analysis is an integral part of solar plant simulations, the shadow analysis is one of the most essential steps in the phase of solar energy system design or analysis. In photovoltaic s, it is important to analyse shading caused by surrounding objects and/or vegetation. A few of the evaluation methods include a ray tracing algorithm, and a ray casting algorithm. The ray-tracing algorithm has been developed to model solar radiation interaction with complex urban environments and, in particular, its effects, including the total irradiance on each surface and overall dissipated power contribution. In three-dimensional (3D) computer graphics, ray tracing is a rendering technique for generating an image by tracing the path of light as pixels in an image plane and simulating the effects of its encounters with virtual objects. The ray tracing can enable more accurate shadow estimation, however, ray tracing can be computationally expensive.

\[0005\] Ray casting is a conventional and accurate shading evaluation method, ray casting is a method for calculating the field of vision where rays are traced from the center of a source square to a select number of destination squares. This method covers every potential destination, however, provides many artifacts in results and can be computationally expensive. The conventional algorithms used to implement shadow analysis are

computationally expensive which makes it harder to be used on low -level machines and realtime applications.

\[0006\] Therefore, there is a need in the art to provide a means that generates the shadow map using less computational resources which enables the user to visualize interactively at every step of designing rather than waiting for completing the designing process and generating the shadow analysis.

OBJECTS OF THE PRESENT DISCLOSURE

\[0007\] An object of the present disclosure relates, in general, to renewable power systems, and more specifically, relates to a system and method for irradiance estimation on solar panels.

\[0008\] Another object of the present disclosure is to provide a computationally inexpensive system.

\[0009\] Another object of the present disclosure is to provide a system which can be used on low-level machines and real-time applications.

\[0010\] Yet another object of the present disclosure is to provide a system that generates the shadow map using fewer computational resources enabling the user to visualize interactively at every step of designing, rather than waiting for the completion of the designing process and the generation of shadow analysis.

SUMMARY

\[0011\] The present disclosure relates, in general, to renewable power systems, and more specifically, relates to a system and method for irradiance estimation on solar panels. The main objective of the present disclosure is to overcome the drawback, limitations, and shortcomings of the existing system and solution, by providing a system having a shadow engine to give irradiation estimate for a solar panel by ray casting from the panel to the light source.

\[0012\] The present disclosure includes the system for estimating solar panel irradiance. The system includes a processor operatively coupled to a memory, the memory storing instructions executable by the processor to receive a set of aerial data of a region of interest on which one or more solar panels are located. The region of interest is selected from buildings, overhanging roof surfaces, and any combination thereof. The processor can calculate the edges of all obstacles in the region of interest, and calculate the position of the

light source at regular intervals based on geolocation coordinates, where the geolocation coordinates include latitude, longitude and altitude.

\[0013\] The processor can determine a set of parameters for each solar panel of one or more solar panels. The set of parameters pertains to any or a combination of tilt and azimuth angle. The processor can trace the ray of light by simulation from one or more solar panels to the direction of the light source to generate shadow simulation data representing shade patterns and unshaded patterns of one or more solar panels. The processor is configured to determine an irradiance value for one or more solar panels based on the generated shadow simulation data. Thus, the ray of light is used to track the position of the sun and to determine the optimal angle for the solar panel.

\[0014\] Accordingly, the processor is configured to determine the presence and absence of any obstacles that obstruct the ray of light between one or more solar panels and the light source. The presence of any obstacles that obstruct the ray of light between at least one solar panel of the one or more solar panels and the light source is considered as the shaded patterns in that timestamp. Similarly, the absence of any obstacles that obstruct the ray of light between the one or more solar panels and the light source is considered the unshaded pattern. The obstacles are selected from chimneys, trees, surrounding obstructions and any combination thereof.

\[0015\] Moreover, the processor is operatively coupled to the shadow engine that estimates the amount of the light source that is incident on the one or more solar panels at a given time and location. The processor, on receipt of data pertaining to position and direction of light, is configured to generate the shadow simulation data by calculating at least two possible sides of the one or more solar panels to reduce the complexity.

\[0016\] Those skilled in the art would appreciate that as the conventional method is avoided in the present invention, the system generates the shadow map using fewer computational resources which enables the user to visualize interactively at every step of designing rather than waiting for completing the designing process and generating the shadow analysis.

\[0017\] Various objects, features, aspects, and advantages of the inventive subject matter will become more apparent from the following detailed description of preferred embodiments, along with the accompanying drawing figures in which like numerals represent like components.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION

\[0025\] The following is a detailed description of embodiments of the disclosure depicted in the accompanying drawings. The embodiments are in such detail as to clearly communicate the disclosure. If the specification states a component or feature “may”, “can”, “could”, or “might” be included or have a characteristic, that particular component or feature is not required to be included or have the characteristic.

\[0026\] As used in the description herein and throughout the claims that follow, the meaning of “a,” “an,” and “the” includes plural reference unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Also, as used in the description herein, the meaning of “in” includes “in” and “on” unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.

\[0027\] The present disclosure relates, in general, to renewable power systems, and more specifically, relates to a system and method for irradiance estimation on solar panels. The proposed system disclosed in the present disclosure overcomes the drawbacks, shortcomings, and limitations associated with the conventional system by providing a shadow engine to give an irradiation estimate for a solar panel by ray casting from the panel to the

sun. For finding the shadow at each hour, the common method used in other software is to create rays from the light source to the solar panel and check what rays are falling on the object and not getting blocked by any obstacles. This determines which objects are shaded and which objects are not shaded.

\[0028\] In the proposed simulations, a ray is cast from the object to the light source and determined if there is an object in between. If there is an obstacle in between blocking the casted ray, it is considered as shaded otherwise unshaded.

\[0029\] The present disclosure generates the shadow map using less computational resources which enables the user to visualize interactively at every step of designing rather than waiting for completing the designing process and generating the shadow analysis. To achieve the results discussed above, the following steps are being followed:

• Calculation of edges of all obstacles.

• Calculation of sun position at each hour based on the geolocation coordinates like latitude, longitude and altitude.

• For each solar panel, the tilt and azimuth are considered.

• A ray of light is traced by simulation from the solar panel to the direction of the sun.

• If there is any obstacle that obstructs the ray, that particular panel is considered shaded in that timestamp.

• If there is an absence of obstacles between the panel and the sun, then the panel is considered unshaded. The present disclosure can be described in enabling detail in the following examples, which may represent more than one embodiment of the present disclosure.

\[0030\] The advantages achieved by the system of the present disclosure can be clear from the embodiments provided herein. The system is computationally inexpensive and can be used on low-level machines and real-time applications. The system generates the shadow map using fewer computational resources enabling the user to visualize interactively at every step of designing, rather than waiting for the completion of the designing process and the generation of shadow analysis. The description of terms and features related to the present disclosure shall be clear from the embodiments that are illustrated and described; however, the invention is not limited to these embodiments only. Numerous modifications, changes, variations, substitutions, and equivalents of the embodiments are possible within the scope of the present disclosure. Additionally, the invention can include other embodiments that are

within the scope of the claims but are not described in detail with respect to the following description.

\[0031\] FIG. 1A illustrates an exemplary representation of a system for irradiance estimation on solar panels, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.

\[0032\] Referring to FIG. 1A, a system 100 configured for irradiance estimation on solar panels 102. System 100 can include a shadow engine 212 (shown in FIG. 2 and described in detail below) that can provide an irradiation estimate for one or more solar panels 102 (also referred to as solar panel 102, herein) by ray casting from an object to a light source 104, where the object can be solar panels 102and the light source 104 is the sun. The solar panels 102 have a front surface, a back surface and a plurality of sides. The solar panels 102 are generally composed of a plurality of solar cells that are arranged in a grid-like pattern on a substrate. The solar cells are typically made of silicon, and are connected together in series and/or parallel to form the solar panel 102. In operation, the solar panel converts sunlight into electrical energy that can be used to power electrical devices.

\[0033\] The solar panels, also known as photovoltaic (PV) panels, may be installed as part of a system for capturing and storing energy from a light source using solar cells. Solar panels may be configured as free-standing installations or may be installed onto various types of structures. Solar panel installations may include multiple different components, such as, for example, frames, inverters, batteries and the like.

\[0034\] The system 100 may be implemented as an application on a server 110, it may be understood that the system lOOmay be accessed by multiple users through computing devices 106, such as a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a notebook, a workstation and the like. The computing devicel06 may be configured to provide a software tool having a user interface for designing and selecting solar panel layouts. The associated user interfaces may be provided for creating solar panel layouts on land and/or physical structures at a location. The user interfaces as illustrated in FIG. IB potentially may be provided including a graphical representation of the location and any structures at the location, and including multiple user options for designing the solar panel layouts at the location based on the retrieved information and other factors.

\[0035\] In an embodiment, the computing device 106 can receive information corresponding to the location, provide the user interface displaying the representation of the physical structure at the location and provide through the user interface user options for designing the solar panel layout for the physical structure, where the user options are based on the retrieved information corresponding to the physical structure at the location.

\[0036\] The computing device 106 having a processor 202 operatively coupled to a memory 204 shown in FIG. 2.The memory 204storing instructions executable by the processor 202 to receive a set of aerial data of a region of interest on which the one or more solar panels 102 may be located. The region of interest is selected from buildings, overhanging roof surfaces, and any combination thereof.

\[0037\] The processor 202 is configured to perform the calculation of edges of all obstacles, where the obstacles may include chimneys, trees, surrounding obstructions, and other physical objects that may reduce the amount of sunlight reaching solar panels in certain potential layout positions.

\[0038\] The processor 202is configured to perform the calculation of light source 104 e.g., sun position at each hour based on the geolocation coordinates like latitude, longitude and altitude. For each solar panel, a set of parameters like tilt and azimuth angle are considered. A ray of light is traced by simulation from the solar panel 102 to the direction of the light source 104i.e., sun to generate shadow simulation data representing shade patterns and unshaded patterns of the solar panels 102, where based on the generated shadow simulation data, the processor 202 configured to determine an irradiance value for the solar panels 102.

\[0039\] Accordingly, processor 202 is configured to determine the presence and absence of any obstacles that obstruct the ray of light between the solar panels 102 and the light source 104. The presence of any obstacles that obstruct the ray of light between at least one solar panel of the solar panels and the light source is considered as the shaded patterns in that timestamp. Similarly, the absence of any obstacles that obstruct the ray of light between the solar panels 102 and the light source 104 is considered the unshaded pattern. The processor, on receipt of data pertaining to position and direction of light, is configured to generate the shadow simulation data by calculating at least two possible sides of one or more solar panels to reduce the complexity. In other words, to reduce the complexity of the algorithm, the shadow is calculated only on the two possible sides of the solar panel as the direction of light is known.

\[0040\] For example, the solar panel layout installed on a roof surface adjacent to several tall trees or a nearby chimney may receive less sunlight than it otherwise would if these shading factors were not present. Therefore, shadow engine 212 may estimate the amount of solar radiation that would fall on the solar panel by casting from the panel to the sun. This may allow for a real-time estimate of the amount of solar radiation that the panel may receive and can be used to optimize the panel's position to maximize its efficiency.

\[0041\] The system 100 may have processor 202 for controlling the overall operation of server 110 and its associated components, including random access memory (RAM), readonly memory (ROM), input/output (I/O) module, memory 204 and shadow engine 212 as illustrated in FIG. 2.

In other examples, the processing engine(s) 208 may be implemented by electronic circuitry.

\[0050\] In an exemplary embodiment, the processing engine(s) 208 may include shadow engine 212. The shadow engine 212 is a computer program that uses ray casting to estimate the amount of sunlight that would be incident on a solar panel at a given time and location. The shadow engine casts rays from the solar panel to the sun. The amount of sunlight that is intercepted by the solar panel is used to calculate the amount of electricity that the panel can generate.

\[0051\] The shadow engine 212 can be used to estimate the amount of electricity that a solar panel can generate over the course of a day, a year, or any other period of time. The shadow engine can also be used to estimate the amount of electricity that a solar panel can generate at a particular location.

\[0055\] At block 304, the processor can perform the calculation of the sun position at each hour based on the geolocation coordinates like latitude, longitude and altitude.

\[0056\] At block 306, the processor considers the tilt and azimuth for each solar panel. At block 308, a ray of light is traced by simulation from the solar panel to the direction of the sun.

\[0057\] At block 310, if there is any obstacle that obstructs the ray, that particular panel is considered as shaded in that timestamp and at block 312, if there is the absence of an obstacle between the panel and the sun, then the panel is considered as unshaded. To further reduce the complexity of the algorithm the shadow is calculated only on the two possible sides of the solar panel as we know the direction of light. This gives us a method which is computationally inexpensive and could be used in building more user-interactive applications.
